SVG Demo
========

A mostly useless web app demonstrating how SVG format works. Created as a university homework.

Can be used in two modes: in draw mode it is a simple graphics editor which updates and displays corresponding SVG code in real-time as the image is drawn.

In write mode SVG code can be edited directly, and the resulting image will change accordingly.

Draw mode doesn't work on most touch devices, as only mouse events are supported at the moment.
