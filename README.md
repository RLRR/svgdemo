SVG Demo
========

A mostly useless web app demonstrating how SVG format works. Can be used in two modes: in draw mode it is a simple graphics editor which updates and displays corresponding SVG code in real-time as you draw the image.

In write mode you can edit SVG code directly and see the resulting image change accordingly.

See it in action at (http://svg.fedosov.me/).
