SVG Demo
========

A mostly useless web app demonstrating how SVG format works. Can be used in two modes: in draw mode it is a simple graphics editor which updates and displays corresponding SVG code in real-time as the image is drawn.

In write mode SVG code can be edited directly, and the resulting image will change accordingly.

See it in action at http://svg.fedosov.me/.
